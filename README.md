# Summit DataViz Challenge 2025

![hello](https://github.com/summitllc/Summit-DataViz/blob/main/Summit%20DataViz%20Challenge%202025.png?raw=true)

## Purpose
Summit's DataViz Challenge is designed to celebrate creativity and skill in data visualization by giving all participants the same dataset and challenging them to produce unique, insightful, and beautiful visuals. Winners will receive a monetary award, bragging rights for an ENTIRE year, and the potential use of your visualization in Summit marketing materials. 

## Who Can Participate?
The challenge is open to anyone at Summit (Analyst through Senior Consultant). You do **not** need to be a coder to join — if you enjoy working with data, designing visuals, or telling stories through charts, this challenge is for you! Whether you use Excel, R, Python, Stata, Tableau, or glitter glue on a paper plate (okay, maybe not that last one), the goal is to explore data creatively and share your perspective. If you're new to visualization but love data, you're encouraged to find a partner! 

## Challenge Overview 
Participants will be given a surprise dataset on launch day (11/17). Using any tool (examples: R, Excel, Python, PowerBI), they'll create a visualization that communicates a clear insight or narrative.

## Timeline
- **Sign Up Deadline: Thursday, November 13**
- **Dataset Released:** Monday, November 17
- **Kickoff Session:** Monday, November 17
- **Submission Due:** Monday, December 8
- **Voting:** Friday, December 12 - Tuesday, December 16
- **Winners Announced:** Wednesday, December 17

## Dataset Notes
The dataset will be uploaded to the [Data](Data/) within this repository on 11/17. Any notes will also be released at the start of the challenge!

*Hint hint: Brush up on your fed cred knowledge (or start looking for a partner)*

## Guidelines & Rules
- Participants **must sign up by 11/13**. Sign up by dropping a comment [here](https://github.com/summitllc/Summit-DataViz/issues/2).
- Participants will receive up to 9 hours of time in Unanet (this includes time for the kickoff session).
  - Participants are not required to use the entire 9 hours.
  - Any additional time spent on the visualization is considered personal time (aka your timesheet will be rejected if you put in over 9 hours).
- Participants may use any visualization tool and any visualization format that best tells the story (e.g., static, interactive).
- Entries should include a title, a brief description, and the visualization.
- Team or solo entries are allowed. If you are entering a team, you may submit only one visualization.
- If using a coding language (R, Python, etc.), keep it reproducible.
- While we want participants to think outside the box when it comes to the visualization, don't forget about the storytelling aspect. The goal is to reveal insights, patterns, or trends clearly, not create a [pictorial bar chart](https://datavizproject.com/data-type/pictorial-bar-chart/) just because it's admittedly pretty fun. 

## Submission Instructions
1. Create your own branch.
2. Create a folder with your name to the [Submissions](Submissions/) folder in this repository. For example, `/submissions/OliviaHebner/`.
3. Add your visualization and a brief description inside your folder.
4. Open a pull request by the submission deadline.

**NOTE:** If you are not using a coding language or do not have a GitHub account, please reach out to Olivia for submission help! If you want to test your GitHub skills, but need a refresher, please reference our [GitHub Guide](https://summitllc.sharepoint.com/sites/KnowledgeManagement/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FKnowledgeManagement%2FShared%20Documents%2FCode%20Standards%2FSummit%20Git%20Guide%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FKnowledgeManagement%2FShared%20Documents%2FCode%20Standards).

## Judging Criteria
Summit's leadership team will select the winners (awards below) based on the following criteria: 
- Clarity: Is the insight or story easy to understand?
- Creativity: Does the design stand out or use novel techniques?
- Analytical Rigor: Is the visualization grounded in accurate analysis?
- Aesthetics: Is it polished and visually engaging? Does it follow Summit's Style Guide?
